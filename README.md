# Claudia Gaspar - Business & Data portfolio
## About
Hey, I'm Cláudia, part data enthusiast, part problem-solver, and full-time coffee fan.
My background is in logistics and business analysis, where every decision depends on timing, precision, and a good sense of curiosity. I discovered that what I enjoy most is transforming messy data into something that makes sense and actually helps people make better choices. Since my professional projects are confidential, this portfolio became my lab, a space to experiment, learn, and show how I use analytics to turn questions into insights.

Each project you’ll find here tells a small story: testing tools, exploring data, and connecting logic with creativity. It’s my way of proving that data can be practical, strategic, and a little bit fun.

So grab a coffee, dive in, and remember: no spreadsheets were harmed in the making of this portfolio.
